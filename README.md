# Mind-Guardian
## Inspiration
We wanted to address individual mental health and insecurities by practising positive reinforcement and healthy mindset strategies.

## What it does
It allows a user to practise using a positive mindset when faced with negative thoughts while playing a fun game with comforting graphics. The demon represents our intrusive, bad thoughts that is said against us. The user must defend themselves from these negative thoughts by choosing positive mindsets to take it down. 

## How we built it
Took inspiration from previous games and altered it to fit our goals
Used python to code our game using pygames
Used language AI to implement our questions and answers for user to read and respond
Used Figma for prototype 

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered lots of issues with graphics, including animating the character’s movement 
We also had trouble implementing the Cohere API
In execution, the app crashes due to a heavy load
The amount of time to work on it

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We all learned how to use Pygame and successfully implemented our fi
We are proud of our visualisation with high quality graphics and animation

How to implement Cohere language AI
How to use Figma for wireframing
